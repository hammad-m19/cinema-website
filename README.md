# Project Title: CineScope – Movie Showtimes Website
Description:
CineScope is a simple and stylish movie showtimes website that displays “Now Showing” and “Upcoming” movies using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically loads movie data from local JSON files and presents each movie in a card format with posters, genres, and a booking button. Users can click “Book Ticket” to simulate booking a movie, and the selected movie is stored using localStorage for later use.
The project includes:
•	Responsive layout with clean UI
•	Use of JavaScript fetch() for dynamic content loading
•	Offline-ready setup using local JSON files
•	Basic navigation and animations (via AOS library)
This project is ideal for beginners learning how to connect HTML pages with external JSON data using JavaScript and create interactive, multi-page websites.
